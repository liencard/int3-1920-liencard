# INT3-1920

## Project
The assignment was composed of two parts.

### `webshop`
For one, we had to make a responsive webshop for HUMO where they would sell some books and gadgets.

### `longread`
The other part was that each book would have a detail page in the form of a longread. We had to design & develop one long read of a chosen book.

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn devt`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

### `yarn prod`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
